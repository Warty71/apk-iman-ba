# wart-iman-ba
Repository used for my iman.ba mobile app.
The idea of the app is to allow people a fast and reliable source of expanding their knowledge about islam, be it questions from people of other religions, atheistic, or students of islam wishing to learn more.

App development plan:
  1. Get the UI/UX design on Figma,
  2. Create the app UI using Flutter (50%),

  4. Add state management (Provider or BLoC),
  5. Make a web apk that will serve as a master app to manipulate the Firebase database(50%),
  6. Present the app to the client,
